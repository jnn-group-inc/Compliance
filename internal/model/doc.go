/*
Package model defines the comply data model.

Markdown Wrappers

The model package treats typed markdown files as model objects. All wrapped markdown documents are assumed to have a YAML header and a markdown body separated by three dashes: "---".

Local Ticket Cache

Tickets are defined externally (in the configured ticketing system), and cached locally for rapid dashboard rendering.
